## This is a header.

So we said we were going to talk about Global Object Methods, well, `Array.length` is actually a property.

That distinction isn't something that you need to worry about right now.  Very simply, `array.length` is a helper designed to quickly tell you how many items are in an array.`String.length` is used very similarly, it will tell you how many characters there are in a string.

***Challenge Description 1***

##### Comparing two arrays

If we have two arrays.

```var Arr1 = ['a', 'r', 'r', 'a', 'y', 1]```

and

```var Arr2 = ['a', 'r', 'r', 'a', 'y', 't', 'w', 'o']```

Write a JavaScript `if else` statement that console.logs the length of the longer array.

***Code Solution 1***

if ( arr1.length > arr2.length) {
console.log(arr1.length) 
} else {
console.log(arr2.length)
}

***Challenge Description 2***
##### Looping Through an Array

Given this array of numbers

`var arr = [2, 3, 6, 13, 2, 1, 7]`

Write a `for loop` that iterates through the whole array except for the last number, and console.logs each number as it iterates. Hint: You must use array.length but you will need to modify it slightly.

Remember, here is the standard syntax for a for loop.

```javascript
for ( var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(xyz)
}
```


***CODE SOLUTION 2***

for ( var i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i])
}

Great work! If you found this lesson to be very easy, not to worry, things will ramp up shortly. `Arr.length` can be used in so many different ways, using it will soon become second nature. We will see you in the next lesson!
